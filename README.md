#TrafficVision: Revamping Urban Planning

##Using Object recognition to differentiate different vehicle classes and the quantity of each going through a pre-determined street each day for urban city planning!

The aim of this project is to leverage deep learning and object recognition to distinguish various types of vehicles and quantify their daily volume on a designated city street. By doing so, the quality, quantity, and speed of data collection for urban planners could be improved efficiently, aiding in the assessment of street congestion mitigation and superior overall city planning. The gathered data can assist with decisions on road expansion, bike lanes, bus lanes, HVO lanes, sidewalk requirements, crosswalk viability, overhead bridge viability, and new intersection possibilities, ultimately enhancing urban infrastructure and transportation planning.
